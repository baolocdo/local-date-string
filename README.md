Go to `local-date-string.js` and implement the function `getLocalDate()`. You should only change the `result` with the correct formula.

Note that `month`, `day`, and `year` are the function's parameters that will be given by the function caller so there are no concrete values for them. You need to think in abstraction instead of hard-coding any strings in this function.
